PA88 based HV amp 200v

This is (hopefully) a precision amplifier.
It is setup for 20x amplification and maximum output a bit over +-200v
Maximum output at higher frequency (> 20kHz) is limited. I will publish test data as I complete the project.

The power supply section is based on a design by https://www.changpuak.ch/electronics/VB408.php

It uses 2 A41-25-230L Transformers, these transformers can be configured both for 115V and 220V input. These are not 1:1 transformers, the 220V output is at rated current, with lower current voltage can be quite higher, I decided to wire them in reverse compared to the marking to have slightly lower voltage into the power supply, and avoid stressing the 400v capacitors.
